# Terraform
##### _By Ako Seneki_
### What is Terraform?
* Terraform is a tool for infrastructure provisioning
* It automates and manages your infrastructure
* Provisions your platform (cloud)
* And the services that run on the platform

### Where does the Terraform comes into picture in the DevOps space?
* Provisioning infrastructure
* Deploying Application (esp. the microservices applications)

### To do the infrastructure provisioning - it means to:
* create VPC
* spin up servers
* install docker
* create Azure/AWS users and permissions

### What is the Difference between Ansible and Terraform?
* Both are Infrastructure as code (IaC)
* But the Terraform mainly deals with infrastructure provisioning
* While on the other hand, ansible is mainly a configuration tool that does the following:
    - Configure that infrastructure
    - deploy apps
    - install/update software
* Ansible is more mature while terrform is relatively new
* Terraform is more advanced in orchestration
* So to conclude, terrafrom is better at provisioning infrastructure and ansible is good for configuring that provisioned infrastructure
*
